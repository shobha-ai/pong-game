# Add project specific ProGuard rules here.
# By default, the flags in R8's consumer-rules.pro file are applied,
# which includes general rules for Android applications.
# You can find the rules file in the Android SDK at:
# <sdk>/tools/proguard/proguard-android-optimize.txt

# For more details, see
#   http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/proguard.html

# If you are using a library that requires specific ProGuard rules,
# please add them here.
